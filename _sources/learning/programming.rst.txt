Everything related to learning programming


General

First off, **Google is your friend!**
It's unlikely you are the first person to have whatever problem you are having,
and chances are if you search the error you will find someone with a solution,
which leads to the next resource.

Chances are, you will find the answers to the problems you may have on a site
called `Stack Overflow. <https://stackoverflow.com>`_
**Stack Overflow is also your friend!**  You will find most of the answers you
need there.

Python
++++++

There are many ways to learn Python.

A great place to start is the `official Python tutorial`_.
Chapters 1-4 will introduce basic concepts, 5-9 expand and will teach you nearly
everything you would ever need to know to program a robot.
At the very least, you must read chapters 1-4 and chapter 9 which explains
classes, which are the building blocks of the robot.

If you're too lazy to even look at the official tutorial `here's <https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/index.html>`_
the official
Readthedocs for robotpy. Read all of this,and you'll be pretty much covered.


There are also many websites you can use to learn Python.

* `Learn Python the Hard Way`_
  provides an easy to follow guided tutorial on the language
* `Codecademy`_ provides an interactive tutorial with an online editor
* If you want more self guided instruction:

    * `Exercism`_ provides problems where you submit the solution but does not guide you though it
    * `Codewars`_ and similar sites provide competition where you can improve your programming skill by completing short challenges.
