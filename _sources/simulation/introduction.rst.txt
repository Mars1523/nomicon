Introduction 
============

Testing code is incredibly important, but can be hard to get right.
The only thing harder is getting your hands on an actual robot to test your code
on.  This is where the simulator comes in.

Simualation
+++++++++++

First off, keep in mind, this is a basic, 2d physics simulation. It can simulate
basic physics in perfect world, but will not accurately reflect the real world
in every detail. Maybe in the future Gazebo_ can help simulate full robots from
CAD models, (this is supposed to be supported for 2019).
